\justifying {Smart metering is a quite new field that has grabbed significant attention.
Accurate forecasting of electricity usage will enable a utility provider to plan the
resources and take control actions to balance the electricity demand and supply.
Current forecasting methods in the literature are not accurate. Furthermore, they
could not help users to choose the optimal usage plan. In this thesis, a novel method
for electricity usage forecasting is proposed. Specifically, smart meter data from Irish
Social Science Data Archive has been obtained and a deep learning model is proposed
for electricity usage forecasting using the smart meter data. The results demonstrate
the advantage of deep learning and as a result, appropriate choice of usage plan for
the users can be achieved.}
